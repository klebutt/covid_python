# covid_python
Personal project analysing covid_19, conducted in python.  

## Data Source  
Covid-19 dataset from Our World in Data (OWID):  
Website: https://www.ourworldindata.org/coronavirus   
GitHub: https://www.github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data  
This is an external and open-source dataset. OWID collects data from governmental organisations around the world and compiles it in to one csv file. There are limitations to the collection of data, as different governments have different practises for collecting and sharing data.   
I have chosen this data because it is a very current issue which is having a huge impact on peoples lives across the globe. There is also a large volume of data to analyise which makes it an interesting project.   

## Questions to Explore  
•	How is the stringency of countries lockdowns related to cases of covid-19?  
•	How is the population density of countries related to cases of covid-19?  
•	How are HDI ratings related to covid-19 deaths?  
•	How does gdp per capita relate to covid-19 deaths?  
•	What is the effect of vaccinations on the reproduction rate of covid-19?  
•	How do rates of covid-19 compare amongst countries with a similar population?  
•	How do rates of cardiovascular disease effect hospitalisations due to covid-19?
